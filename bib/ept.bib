	abstract = {This study investigated the positive and negative responses of 1488 teeth in 60 patients to two electric pulp testers and a cold thermal pulp test. Three subgroups of known pulpless or pulpally diseased teeth (teeth receiving root canal therapy, teeth with root canal fillings, or teeth with confirmed associated apical radiolucencies) were identified and their responses evaluated separately. Testing was performed on two tooth surfaces, the facio-occlusal and faciocervical, and on all restorations. The gingival tissue of each patient also was tested using both electrical tests. The primary findings were: (a) teeth not responding to cold and either not responding or responding at readings greater than the tissue response to electrical had a high probability of being in the known pulpless or pulpally diseased subgroups; (b) the only false positive responses to cold in the three subgroups were in multirooted teeth with probable vital tissue remaining in at least one canal; and (c) in the three subgroups, if the false positive responses to electrical that responded at levels higher than the patient's tissue response were considered to be negative responses, the difference in false positives between cold and electrical became not statistically significant (p = 0.07).},

	abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate and compare the reliability of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), pulse oximetry (PO) and electric pulp tester (EPT) for assessing the pulpal status as a vitality test method by calculating their sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Data were collected from 59 pairs of maxillary anterior teeth (38 pairs of central, 21 pairs of lateral incisors) in 51 patients (range 12-18years, mean age 14.6$\pm$1.73years, 28 women, 23 men). The teeth with complete endodontic fillings constituted the study group, and the healthy, contralateral teeth of the same patients were constituted the control group. The calculated sensitivity was 0.915 for the EPT and 0.813 for the PO. And the specificity of EPT was 0.881 and PO was 0.949. The difference between the LDF values obtained from the study, and control group was statistically significant (P=0.0001). The findings of this study indicated that LDF can reliably discriminate the vitality of the teeth with a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 for this sample. Laser Doppler flowmetry was found to be a more reliable and effective method than PO and EPT of assessing the pulpal status of human teeth.},

	abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the clinical accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), an electric pulp test (EPT), and various thermal pulp sensibility tests. Methods Pulp tests were done on 121 teeth in 20 subjects by using LDF, EPT, and thermal pulp testing (CO2, Endo Frost {$[$}EF{$]$}, Ice) during 2 or 3 test sessions with at least 1-week intervals. The order of testing was reversed on the second visit. A laser Doppler flowmeter was used to measure mean pulp blood flow (Flux) calibrated against a brownian motion medium and zeroed against a static reflector. The laser source was 780 nm, with 0.5-mm fiber separation in the probe, 3.1 kHz as the primary bandwidth for filter set to 0.1-second time output constant. Customized polyvinylsiloxane splints were fabricated for each participant, and a minimum of 90-second recording time was used for each tooth. Raw data were analyzed by using repeated measure analysis of variance, pairwise comparisons, and interclass correlations (ICC). Results The accuracy of EPT, CO2, and LDF tests was 97.7{\%}, 97.0{\%}, and 96.3{\%}, respectively, without significant differences (P > .3). Accuracy of EF and Ice was 90.7{\%} and 84.8{\%}, respectively. EPT (P = .015) and CO2 (P = .022) were significantly more accurate than EF. LDF was more accurate than EF, but this was not statistically significant (P = .063). Ice was significantly less accurate than EPT (P = .004), CO2 (P = .005), LDF (P = .006), and EF (P = .019). With the exception of Ice (effect of visit: F2,38 = 5.67, mean squared error = 0.01, P = .007, $\eta$2p = 0.23), all tests were reliable. Ice (ICC = 0.677) and LDF (ICC = 0.654) were the most repeatable of the tests, whereas EPT (ICC = 0.434) and CO2 (ICC = 0.432) were less repeatable. Conclusions CO2, EPT, and LDF were reliable and the most accurate tests, but CO2 and EPT were less repeatable yet less time-consuming than LDF. EF was reliable but not as accurate as EPT and CO2 and less repeatable than Ice and LDF. Ice was the most repeatable but the least accurate and least reliable test.},

	abstract = {Introduction The ideal technique for the evaluation of pulp vitality should be noninvasive, painless, objective, reliable, and reproducible. To achieve this, the most routine tests are sensitivity tests. However, a major shortcoming with these tests is that they indirectly indicate pulp vitality by measuring a neural response. Pulse oximetry is a well-established oxygen saturation monitoring technique broadly used in medicine. However, its efficacy as the pulp vitality test should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to design and build a custom-made pulse oximeter dental probe and to evaluate its efficacy in comparison with electric pulp tester, cold spray, and a rubber cup in pulp vitality testing. Methods Twenty-four single-canal mandibular premolars needing endodontic treatment were selected. The patients did not have systemic disease and did not consume drugs. Also, they had no clinically relevant signs of necrosis. The selected teeth were pulpally tested with 4 kinds of tests including pulse oximetry, the electric test, cold spray, and the rubber cup. After endodontic treatment of these teeth, which revealed the actual status of the pulp, the results were analyzed by the kappa test to show the efficacy of these tests. Results When comparing electric, cold, heat, and pulse oximeter tests with the gold standard, the kappa agreement coefficient was 18{\%}, 18{\%}, 14{\%}, and 91{\%}, respectively. The sensitivity of pulse oximetry, a rubber cup, electric test, and cold spray was 0.93, 0.60, 0.60, and 0.53, respectively. The specificity of these tests was 1.00, 0.55, 0.22, and 0.66, respectively. Conclusions Pulp testing by using pulse oximetry is more reliable than the electric test, rubber cup, and cold spray. The custom-made pulse oximeter dental probe is an effective and objective method for pulp vitality assessment.},

The teeth were also tested with a cold stimulus (ethyl chloride on cotton wool), then extracted, processed and examined by light microscopy. Histologically, 38 teeth were vital and 7 non-vital. The best prediction of vitality was from ethyl chloride (80{\%} correct) or bipolar stimuli of 10 ms duration and up to 200 $\mu$A (73{\%} correct). The remaining 5 teeth had vital radicular pulps and necrotic tissue coronally, but a comparison between the results of monopolar and bipolar stimulation did not permit the detection of this group. There was no correlation between the electrical threshold and presence of caries, restorations, pulp stones or diffuse pulpal mineralization.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the presence of microorganisms and analyzed microscopically the pulp of 20 traumatized human teeth with intact crowns and clinical diagnosis of pulp necrosis, based on the association of at least three of the clinical criteria: crown discoloration, negative response to thermal and electric pulp vitality tests, positive response to vertical and horizontal percussion, pain on palpation or mobility.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Microbiological collection was performed from the root canals to evaluate the presence of microorganisms. The pulp samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) for histological evaluation of possible morphological alterations.
RESULTS: Analysis of results was performed by statistical tests (linear regression test and diagnostic analysis) and subjective analysis of the sections stained with H.E. and revealed that only 15% of the sample did not exhibit microbial development. The time elapsed between dental trauma and onset of endodontic intervention ranged from 15 days to 31 months; the percussion test presented high sensitivity (80%) for detection of microorganisms in the root canal of traumatized teeth; 3 teeth (15%) did not present pulp tissue, being characterized as complete autolysis; analysis of pulp samples was performed on the other 17 cases, among which 3 (15%) exhibited partial necrosis without possibility of repair and 14 presented complete necrosis; none of the clinical criteria employed for the diagnosis of pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth was pathognomonic.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results allowed the following conclusions: with regard to microbiological findings, 85% of teeth presented microorganisms in the root canal, despite the presence of an intact crown. Concerning the microscopic findings, 100% of traumatized teeth presented pulp necrosis; the pulp vitality tests based on pulp response to heat, cold and vertical percussion were the most reliable to diagnose pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of thermal and electrical tests to register pulp vitality. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value were calculated by comparing the test results with a "gold standard". The thermal tests studied were a cold test (ethyl chloride) and a heat test (hot gutta-percha). For the electrical test, the Analytic Technology Pulp Tester was used. The examined teeth were 59 teeth with unknown pulpal status in need of endodontic treatment and 16 intact teeth, all with radiographically normal periapical bone structures. In total 46 teeth with vital pulps and 29 teeth with necrotic pulps were tested. This gave a disease prevalence of 39%. The gold standard was established by direct pulp inspection of the 59 teeth in need of endodontic treatment. In the 16 intact teeth the pulp was judged as vital. The number of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN) test results was calculated for each method as compared to the gold standard. Based on this, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for each method. The sensitivity was 0.83 for the cold test, 0.86 for the heat test and 0.72 for the electrical test. The specificity was 0.93 for the cold test, 0.41 for the heat test and 0.93 for the electrical test. The positive predictive value was 0.89 for the cold test, 0.48 for the heat test and 0.88 for the electrical test, and the negative predictive value was 0.90 for the cold test, 0.83 for the heat test and 0.84 for the electrical test. This indicated that the probability of a non-sensitive reaction representing a necrotic pulp was 89% with the cold test, 48% with the heat test and 88% with the electrical test. It also indicated that the probability of a sensitive reaction representing a vital pulp was 90% with the cold test, 83% with the heat test and 84% with the electrical test.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this article, the authors report on an in vivo study in which they assessed the validity of two commonly used cold pulp tests (carbon dioxide [CO(2)]and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and an electrical pulp tester (EPT) in determining pulp vitality by using direct inspection of the pulp as the reference standard.
METHODS: One hundred fifty patients undergoing endodontic therapy at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry (Chapel Hill) undergraduate clinic participated in this study. Before routine endodontic treatment, the authors classified participants by means of EPT, CO(2) and tetrafluoroethane as having either vital or necrotic pulps. Students recorded true pulpal status (vital/necrotic) by observing blood within the pulp chamber after an access cavity was made. The authors calculated the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of each test and the test combinations to describe their validity and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of teeth responding positively to all three tests contained vital pulps, whereas 90 percent of the teeth that failed to respond to any of the tests contained necrotic pulps. Ten percent of the teeth not responding to any of the tests contained vital pulps. For all other combinations of test results, 54 percent of teeth contained vital pulps, and 46 percent contained necrotic pulps.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of either of the cold tests and the EPT for diagnosis of pulpal status.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: For a diagnostic test to be useful, it is necessary to determine the probability that the test will provide the correct diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the predictive value of diagnostics. The aim of the present study was to identify the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and reproducibility of thermal and electrical tests of pulp sensitivity.
METHODS: The thermal tests studied were the 1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane (cold) and hot gutta-percha (hot) tests. For the electrical test, the Analytic Technology Pulp Tester (Analytic Technology, Redmond, WA) was used. A total of 110 teeth were tested: 60 teeth with vital pulp and 50 teeth with necrotic pulps (disease prevalence of 45%). The ideal standard was established by direct pulp inspection.
RESULTS: The sensitivities of the diagnostic tests were 0.88 for the cold test, 0.86 for the heat test, and 0.76 for the electrical test, and the specificity was 1.0 for all 3 tests. The negative predictive value was 0.90 for the cold test, 0.89 for the heat test, and 0.83 for the electrical test, and the positive predictive value was 1.0 for all 3 tests. The highest accuracy (0.94) and reproducibility (0.88) were observed for the cold test.
CONCLUSIONS: The cold test was the most accurate method for diagnostic testing.},

	abstract = {AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the pulp testing methods (pulse oximetry and electric pulp test) in primary and young permanent teeth of children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a total of 155 children aged 4 to 15 years. Twenty children formed control group I. Study group included all healthy, 85 primary 2nd molars in group II and 85 permanent 1st molars in group III. Fifty children needing endodontics treatment formed test group IV. The readings were recorded as true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), false negative (FN). Based on this, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for each method. The results were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: On comparing pulse oximetry with electric pulp test 'p-value' was found to be 0.487 and 1.00 for groups 1 and 2 respectively and was statistically not significant. Whereas 'p-value' for groups 3 and 4 was < 0.0001 and 0.003 respectively and was statistically highly significant.
CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that pulse oximetry can be used as a routine method for assessing the pulp vitality in primary, young permanent and mature permanent teeth.

This study aimed to determine the reliability (measured as the sensitivity and specificity) of laser Doppler flowmetry as a method of assessing the vitality of traumatised anterior teeth, and to compare it with standard pulpal diagnostic tests. Recordings of pulpal blood flow were taken from 67 non-vital anterior teeth (55 patients), where the pulpal status was confirmed by pulpectomy. For comparison, recordings were also taken from 84 vital anterior teeth (84 patients). Analysis of the recordings allowed diagnostic criteria to be developed which gave the technique a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 for this sample. None of the other standard pulpal diagnostic methods tested was as reliable. This was usually due to low sensitivities, which ranged between 0.92 for sensibility testing with ethyl chloride down to 0.36 for periapical radiolucency and 0.16 for a history of pain. Laser Doppler flowmetry was found to be a reliable method of assessing the pulpal status of traumatised anterior teeth, although it is technique-sensitive and time-consuming to use.},

@article{Farid2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electric and thermal tests are the most commonly employed methods for the diagnosis of pulp health status. The objectives of our study are to assess the validity, yield and accuracy of cold and electric pulp tests in determining the vitality of teeth requiring endodontic treatment.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out at the Dental Clinic of Aga Khan University Hospital on 75 patients requiring endodontic treatment. Before commencement of endodontic treatment, a provisional diagnosis of pulp status was made using an electric pulp tester and cold test. The tooth was then labelled as either vital or necrotic. Then an access openings was made and tooth's actual pulp status (vital/necrotic) was determined by observing bleeding in the pulp chamber. The validity, yield and accuracy were calculated on the basis of these findings.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of cold test were 84%, 88%, 93% and 73% respectively. The sensitivity & specificity of electric test were 82% and 88% respectively whereas the positive predictive value negative predictive value of electric test were 93% and 71% respectively. The accuracy of cold and electric pulp test was 85% and 84% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Both cold test and EPT have similar sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values. Although vitality tests have a promising future in the diagnosis of pulp health status but within limitation of this study we found that sensibility tests have satisfactory validity and accuracy values to be used routinely prior to endodontic and restorative treatments especially when used in conjunction with one each other.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine if laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) could aid in distinguishing teeth with necrotic pulps from vital teeth and if so, which configuration of 5 experimental probes would give the best results. Each probe had 3 fibers arranged in a triangle. One fiber carried the laser light to the pulp tissue and 2 fibers carried the back-scattered light to the detector giving the output signal. The distance between the 3 fibers in the triangular arrangement in each probe was 250, 500, 800, 1000, and 1500 microns. A special rubber-base splint was used to hold the probe in place on the buccal surface of the tested teeth. Eleven anterior teeth with clinically diagnosed necrotic pulp were measured with the LDF method and the results compared to contralateral teeth with vital pulp. For the sake of comparison, 10 pairs of anterior teeth with vital pulps in 10 patients were tested as well. The LDF signals were fed into an analog printer and a lap-top computer where all calculations were done. With the LDF method, the output signals from the teeth with necrotic pulps were significantly lower with all 5 probes than the output signals from the contralateral vital teeth. On average, the signal was 42.7% lower from the teeth with necrotic pulps than from the vital teeth. Four of 11 teeth with necrotic pulp gave a positive response to an electrical pulp tester (EPT). The results suggested that the probe with the smallest separation of fibers was the most sensitive in distinguishing necrotic pulps from vital ones.},
