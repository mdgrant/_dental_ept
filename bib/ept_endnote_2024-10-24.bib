	abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the diagnosis criteria of the American Association of Endodontists (AAE), sensitive responses to cold and/or heat tests of suspected teeth compared with those of control teeth can be used for the diagnosis of pulpitis, but the role of electric pulp test (EPT) is not mentioned. It is believed that EPT has some limitations in determining the vitality of the pulp. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the difference in EPT values and the differential diagnoses of reversible pulpitis (RP) and symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIRP) caused by dental caries. METHODS: A total of 203 cases with pulpitis caused by dental caries were included. A diagnosis of pulpitis was made on the basis of the diagnostic criteria of AAE. Patient demographic and clinical examination data were collected. The EPT values of the suspected teeth and control teeth were measured, and the differences between them were calculated. The correlation between the difference in the EPT values and diagnosis of pulpitis was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In the 203 cases (78 males and 125 females; 115 cases of RP, 88 cases of SIRP; 9 anterior teeth, 59 premolars, and 135 molars), the mean patient age was 34.04 $\pm$13.02 (standard deviation) years. The unadjusted (crude) model, model 1 (adjusted for age), model 2 (adjusted for age and sex), and model 3 (adjusted for age, sex, and tooth type) were established for the statistical analyses. In model 3 {$[$}odds ratio (OR) = 1.025; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.002-1.050; P = 0.035{$]$}, the difference in EPT values between RP and SIRP was statistically significant. However, the areas under the curve of predictive probability of the crude model, model 1, model 2, and model 3 were 0.565, 0.570, 0.585, and 0.617, respectively, showing that the model accuracy was low. The P-value for the trend in differences between the EPT values as a categorical variable showed that the differences in the EPT values, comparing RP and SIRP, were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present data, the difference in EPT values was not sufficient to differentiate RP from SIRP.},

@article{Narhi1992,
	abstract = {The arousal of the two components of pain (the first rapid or sharp pain and the second dull pain) are considered to be related to activation of A delta- and C-type nociceptive primary afferents, respectively. The same dichotomy of pain sensations may also exist in teeth, although due to the short distance between the site of stimulation and the brain the two sensations might not be as clearly separated as in stimulation of, for example, the extremities. The sensations evoked by stimulation of human teeth vary according to the type of the stimuli applied. Low-intensity electrical stimulation is able to induce non-painful (prepain) sensations. At high current intensities pain is evoked. Drilling, probing and air-drying of exposed dentin induce only pain. Most studies also indicate that thermal stimulation only induces painful sensations. The quality of dental pain can vary. Typically, dentinal stimulation of teeth with healthy pulps induces sharp pain. On the other hand intense heat stimulation can result in dull pain which radiates to a wider area of the face and jaws. This component of the stimulus-induced pain seems to share some characteristics of toothache associated with painful pulpitis. Single fibre recordings of intradental nerve activity in experimental animals have shown that in addition to A-fibres a considerable number of C-type primary afferents innervate the dental pulp. This is in accordance with the results of neuroanatomical studies, which indicate that 70-80{\%} of pulpal axons in human, monkey, dog, and cat teeth are unmyelinated. Intradental A- and C-fibre groups seem to be functionally different and can be activated separately by certain external stimuli. Comparison of the response characteristics of the pulp nerve fibres and the sensations induced from human teeth indicate that: 1) A-fibres are responsible for the sensitivity of dentine and thus for the mediation of the sharp pain induced by dentinal stimulation, 2) Prepain sensations induced by electrical stimulation result from activation of the lowest threshold A-fibres some of which can be classified as A beta-fibres according to their conduction velocities. Comparison of the responses of the A beta- and A delta-fibres indicate that they belong to the same functional group, 3) Intradental C-fibres are activated only if the external stimuli reach the pulp proper. Their activation may contribute to the dull pain induced by intense thermal stimulation of the tooth and to that associated with pulpal inflammation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a common disease that may have some influence on sensory nerves. The aim of this study was to evaluate dental pulp responses to 2 pulp sensibility tests (ie, cold and electric) in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy individuals. METHODS: Three hundred twenty-two premolar teeth in 51 patients who had type 2 diabetes and 347 premolar teeth in 53 individuals with no medical conditions were investigated. The patients with type 2 diabetes were unified and had fasting plasma glucose <300, hemoglobin A1C <10, less than a 10-year history of diabetes mellitus, and no history of hypertension. Electric and cold pulp sensibility tests were performed for all teeth. The cold test results were recorded by the Heft-Parker visual analog scale, and the electric pulp test results were recorded based on the pulp tester's grade that evoked a response. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between upper and lower premolar teeth in healthy individuals compared with the patients with diabetes in response to the cold and electric pulp tests (P > .05). In the patients with diabetes, the response of their upper premolars to the cold test was significantly reduced in diabetic patients >45 years of age (β= -1.15, P = .013). However, there was no significant correlation between the cold test and age in the lower premolars of both diabetic and nondiabetic participants (P > .05). There was also no significant correlation between the need for a higher number of the electric pulp test current to evoke a response in maxillary and mandibular premolars of the patients with diabetes and nondiabetic participants with age (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation between the reduction of maxillary premolar teeth responses to the cold test in diabetes patients >45 years of age.},

	abstract = {Thermal and electric pulp sensibility tests are commonly used by the majority of clinicians when diagnosing endodontic disease. These tests indirectly determine the state of pulpal health by assessing the response of the Aδnerve fibres within the pulp-dentine complex. A positive response to sensibility testing indicates that the nerve fibres are functioning but does not give any quantitative information on nerve function, pulpal blood flow or histological status of the dental pulp. These tests have inherent limitations, including a reliance on a patient's subjective response to the test and the dentist's interpretation of the patient's response. This two-part series aims to help clinicians to reach an accurate endodontic diagnosis by providing an overview of how to undertake common pulpal sensibility tests correctly, how to interpret their results and understand their limitations. This section provides an overview of pulp testing, definitions of terminology relevant to pulp testing, the diagnostic uses of pulp testing and a summary of the diagnostic accuracy of different pulp tests.},

	abstract = {1. The responses of nerves which could be excited by electrical stimulation of the canine tooth-pulp were recorded from the trigeminal ganglion. 2. Preliminary experiments showed that the responses of mandibular canine pulpal afferents were recorded from the postero-lateral part of the trigeminal ganglion whereas the responses of maxillary canine pulpal afferents were recorded from the central part of the ganglion. 3. The conduction velocity differed in various parts of these nerves; the conduction velocity inside the tooth tended to be slower than that from the tooth to the trigeminal ganglion; the mean conduction velocity in the part of the nerve peripheral to the trigeminal ganglion was faster than that in the part central to the ganglion, and in the central part the conduction velocity decreased caudally. 4. Collision experiments combining tooth stimulation and stimulation of sites in the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex were carried out to investigate the projections of individual pulpal afferents. 5. The results of these experiments showed that some tooth-pulp afferents bifurcate and project to both the main sensory nucleus and the nucleus caudalis. For other pulpal afferents only a projection to the main sensory nucleus or the nucleus caudalis could be demonstrated. 6. Pulpal afferents that bifurcated had faster conduction velocities than those for which no bifurcation could be shown.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This prospective study evaluated the outcome of a combination of nonsurgical endodontic (NSET) and vital pulp therapy (VPT) for the management of mature permanent mandibular molar teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) and apical periodontitis (AP). METHODS: Institutional ethical clearance was obtained. Mandibular molar teeth (N = 60) with a definitive diagnosis of SIP and AP with a radiographic periapical index score (PAI) of ≥3 in either 1 of the roots (mesial or distal) were included. Block randomization was used for allocation. In the NSET group (n = 30), single-visit NSET was performed using a standardized operating protocol. In the NSET-VPT group (n = 30), subsequent to full pulpotomy, at the root orifice where a vital pulp was observed (as determined by the arrest of pulpal bleed upon application of a 2.5{\%} sodium hypochlorite pressure pack), a mineral trioxide aggregate radicular barrier was placed, and it was covered with light-cured resin-modified glass ionomer cement. NSET was performed in the root exhibiting a PAI score ≥3. The tooth was permanently restored. Postoperative pain was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Teeth were followed up clinically and radiographically at 12 months. The presence/absence of symptoms and the change in PAI scores were noted. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The success rate was 90{\%} in the NSET group and 93.3{\%} in the NSET-VPT group. According to an intergroup comparison between the proportion of teeth healed and nonhealed (radiographic), there was no significant difference (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of NSET and VPT is a viable biologically based minimally invasive treatment option for multirooted mandibular teeth with SIP and AP.},

	abstract = {Introduction The ideal technique for the evaluation of pulp vitality should be noninvasive, painless, objective, reliable, and reproducible. To achieve this, the most routine tests are sensitivity tests. However, a major shortcoming with these tests is that they indirectly indicate pulp vitality by measuring a neural response. Pulse oximetry is a well-established oxygen saturation monitoring technique broadly used in medicine. However, its efficacy as the pulp vitality test should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to design and build a custom-made pulse oximeter dental probe and to evaluate its efficacy in comparison with electric pulp tester, cold spray, and a rubber cup in pulp vitality testing. Methods Twenty-four single-canal mandibular premolars needing endodontic treatment were selected. The patients did not have systemic disease and did not consume drugs. Also, they had no clinically relevant signs of necrosis. The selected teeth were pulpally tested with 4 kinds of tests including pulse oximetry, the electric test, cold spray, and the rubber cup. After endodontic treatment of these teeth, which revealed the actual status of the pulp, the results were analyzed by the kappa test to show the efficacy of these tests. Results When comparing electric, cold, heat, and pulse oximeter tests with the gold standard, the kappa agreement coefficient was 18{\%}, 18{\%}, 14{\%}, and 91{\%}, respectively. The sensitivity of pulse oximetry, a rubber cup, electric test, and cold spray was 0.93, 0.60, 0.60, and 0.53, respectively. The specificity of these tests was 1.00, 0.55, 0.22, and 0.66, respectively. Conclusions Pulp testing by using pulse oximetry is more reliable than the electric test, rubber cup, and cold spray. The custom-made pulse oximeter dental probe is an effective and objective method for pulp vitality assessment.},

	abstract = {AIM: This study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of new custom-made pulse oximeter sensor holder in assessment of actual pulp status with three pulp sensibility tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine single canal teeth requiring endodontic therapy was included in the study. The tooth that was requiring root canal treatment was tested with heat test, cold test, electric pulp test, and pulse oximeter. Between each test, a time period of 2 min was allowed. The response from three pulp sensibility tests and the reading from pulse oximeter were recorded. Following which root canal treatment was performed. The result obtained from four pulp tests were correlated with the clinical finding after access cavity preparation. The data obtained was statistically assessed. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of the pulp tests. In the above statistical tools, the probability value. 05 is considered as significant level. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy was found to be significantly higher with pulse oximeter when compared with other three pulp sensibility tests. The ROC curve demonstrates the results obtained from pulse oximeter was found to be more reliable than other pulp tests. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the study, diagnostic accuracy of pulse oximeter with custom made sensor holder was reliable and accurate in assessment of actual pulp status.},

	abstract = {Abstract --The aim of this study was to examine if laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) could aid in distinguishing teeth with necrotic pulps from vital teeth and if so, which configuration of 5 experimental probes would give the best results. Each probe had 3 fibers arranged in a triangle. One fiber carried the laser light to the pulp tissue and 2 fibers carried the back-scattered light to the detector giving the output signal. The distance between the 3 fibers in the triangular arrangement in each probe was 250, 500, 800, 1000, and 1500 jam. A special rubber-base splint was used to hold the probe in place on the buccal surface of the tested teeth. Eleven anterior teeth with clinically diagnosed necrotic pulp were measured with the LDF method and the results compared to contralateral teeth with vital pulp. For the sake of comparison, 10 pairs of anterior teeth with vital pulps in 10 patients were tested as well. The LDF signals were fed into an analog printer and a lap-top computer where all calculations were done. With the LDF method, the output signals from the teeth with necrotic pulps were significantly lower with all 5 probes than the output signals from the contralateral vital teeth. On average, the signal was 42.7{\%} lower from the teeth with necrotic pulps than from the vital teeth. Four of 11 teeth with necrotic pulp gave a positive response to an electrical pulp tester (EPT). The results suggested that the probe with the smallest separation of fibers was the most sensitive in distinguishing necrotic pulps from vital ones.},

@article{Weissheimer2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental studies are controversial regarding the effects of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) on the dental pulp. Therefore, a systematic review of clinical studies is necessary to investigate whether alterations in pulp status occur. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the evidence on radiotherapy for HNC and pulp status. METHODS: A systematic search of articles published until November 2021 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (All Databases), Scopus, EMBASE, and Open Grey databases. The eligibility criteria were based on the PICOS strategy, as follows: (P) vital teeth of adult patients with intraoral and/or oropharyngeal cancer; (I) radiotherapy; (C) control group or values of the same tooth before radiotherapy (basal values); (O) pulpal status after radiotherapy; and (S) clinical studies. The Cochrane Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed and random effects. The overall quality of evidence was assessed through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: Six studies were included for qualitative analysis. Five were classified as serious risk of bias and one as moderate risk of bias. Four studies reported altered pulp responses to cold thermal tests after radiotherapy initiation. Meta-analyses were performed using three included studies. From these, all were included in the meta-analysis for pulp response values to cold sensitivity test immediately after radiotherapy initiation (risk ratio: 0.00 {$[$}CI: 0.00, 0.02{$]$}, p < .00001; I(2)  = 0{\%}); and two in the meta-analysis for pulp response values to cold sensitivity test after 4-5 months of radiotherapy (risk ratio: 0.01 {$[$}CI: 0.00. 0.06{$]$}, p < .00001; I(2)  = 0{\%}). Two reported progressively higher readings to pulp response in the electrical test after radiotherapy initiation (mean difference: -11.46 {$[$}-13.09, -9.84{$]$}, p < .00001; I(2)  = 68{\%}). Two studies demonstrated a pulp oxygen saturation (SpO(2) ) decrease at the end of radiotherapy; and an increase after 4-6 months of radiotherapy beginning. And other demonstrated normal dental pulp SpO(2) 4-6 years after treatment. GRADE analysis presented a moderate certainty of evidence. DISCUSSION: This review verified that radiotherapy for HNC causes significant alterations on the dental pulp responses, but does not seem to induce pulp necrosis. Significant limitations regarding controlling for confounding factors, classification of interventions, and measurement of outcomes were verified, evidencing the need for well-designed studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrated that radiotherapy for HNC induced significant changes in the pulp response with moderate quality of evidence. Such altered responses cannot determine pulp status accurately.},

	abstract = {Electrical excitation of tooth pulp afferents seems to be a most accurate and reproducable method to produce graded pain with minimal injury of the tissues. Besides electrical current only thermal stimulation may activate pulp nerves of an intact tooth, but this method lacks the precision of the electrical stimulation and bears more risk of injury. Surrounded by enamel of high resistance and capasitance the pulp nerves are difficult stimulation objects. On the other hand with careful stimulation the current is almost completely restricted to the pulp. The square wave current pulse is "deformed" according to the time constant of hard tissues and exceptionally long durations are needed. There is ultimate necessity for constant current stimulation because of varying anatomy and resistance of the teeth. When different amplitudes and durations of current pulses are used to compare perception thresholds of human teeth and firing thresholds of single pulp nerve fibres of the cat, it may be concluded that "prepain" sensation is experienced using current values that activate only A-fibres. To attain the pain threshold, recruitment of more A-delta fibres with increasing current is needed, but the lowest thresholds of C-fibres are even higher.},

Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the predictive value of diagnostics. The aim of the present study was to identify the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and reproducibility of thermal and electrical tests of pulp sensitivity. Methods The thermal tests studied were the 1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane (cold) and hot gutta-percha (hot) tests. For the electrical test, the Analytic Technology Pulp Tester (Analytic Technology, Redmond, WA) was used. A total of 110 teeth were tested: 60 teeth with vital pulp and 50 teeth with necrotic pulps (disease prevalence of 45{\%}). The ideal standard was established by direct pulp inspection. Results The sensitivities of the diagnostic tests were 0.88 for the cold test, 0.86 for the heat test, and 0.76 for the electrical test, and the specificity was 1.0 for all 3 tests. The negative predictive value was 0.90 for the cold test, 0.89 for the heat test, and 0.83 for the electrical test, and the positive predictive value was 1.0 for all 3 tests. The highest accuracy (0.94) and reproducibility (0.88) were observed for the cold test. Conclusions The cold test was the most accurate method for diagnostic testing.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of sensibility tests by correlating it with histologic pulp condition. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms were performed on 65 permanent teeth that were scheduled to be extracted for periodontal, prosthodontic or orthodontic reasons. The normal pulp and reversible pulpitis were considered as treatable tooth conditions while irreversible pulpitis and necrosis were considered as untreatable conditions. The teeth were then extracted and sectioned for histological analysis of dental pulp. Histologic status and classification corresponded to the treatable or untreatable pulp condition. Comparisons between histological treatable and untreatable pulp condition were performed with chi-square analysis for sensibility test responses. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy to detect untreatable from treatable pulp condition were calculated for each test. RESULTS: A significant difference was detected in the normal and a sharp lingered response to heat and cold tests. There was significant difference in the negative response to EPT between histological groups. The kappa agreement coefficient between clinical and histological diagnosis of pulp condition was about 0.843 (P<0.001). The accuracy of cold and heat tests and EPT to detect treatable pulp or untreatable pulp states were 78, 74 and 62{\%}, respectively. The sensibility tests diagnosed untreatable pulpitis with a higher probability (NPV=63{\%}-67{\%} -54{\%}, PPV=83{\%}-91{\%} -95{\%} for heat, cold and EPT, respectively). CONCLUSION: Sensibility test results were more likely to diagnose pulpal disease or untreatable pulp conditions. However, to increase the diagnostic accuracy patient history, clinical signs and symptoms and also radiographic findings in conjunction with sensibility tests must be used. The result of this small study demonstrated a good agreement between clinical and histological pulp diagnosis.},

It is paramount that prior to proceeding with a treatment that will affect the contents of the pulp chamber that a clinical diagnosis of the pulp and the periapical tissues is established. This diagnosis should be based on presenting symptoms, history of symptoms, diagnostic tests and clinical findings. If it is not possible to establish the diagnosis or one diagnosis is not dominant within a differential diagnosis, therapy should not be initiated until further evaluation has been performed. In this review, current knowledge on pulpal and periapical status as it pertains to diagnosis will be reviewed. Additionally, most common diagnostic tests will be presented and critically reviewed.},

Exclusion criteria included non-English articles, deciduous teeth, case reports and in vitro studies.Data extraction and synthesis Data extracted included basic study location, sample size, age of participants, pathology of teeth, type of teeth and the vitality (pulse oximetry or Laser Doppler flowmetry) or sensibility test (cold, hot and electric pulp testing) used. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were synthesised (sensitivity, sensibility, predictive values, and likelihood ratios). Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model producing summary values for sensitivity and specificity. Results were presented as a ROC curve. Risk of bias and the quality of the studies were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.Results A total of ten studies were included in the review, of which five were included in the meta-analysis. Overall risk of bias was unclear. Pulse oximetry showed higher diagnostic accuracy than electric pulp testing and thermal testing. Insufficient data precluded quantitative analysis for Laser Doppler flowmetry.Conclusions Pulse oximetry demonstrates greater diagnostic accuracy when compared to sensibility testing. Limited sample size and heterogeneity among the included studies limits their applicability.},

	abstract = {AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the pulp testing methods (pulse oximetry and electric pulp test) in primary and young permanent teeth of children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a total of 155 children aged 4 to 15 years. Twenty children formed control group I. Study group included all healthy, 85 primary 2nd molars in group II and 85 permanent 1st molars in group III. Fifty children needing endodontics treatment formed test group IV. The readings were recorded as true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), false negative (FN). Based on this, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for each method. The results were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test. RESULTS: On comparing pulse oximetry with electric pulp test 'p-value' was found to be 0.487 and 1.00 for groups 1 and 2 respectively and was statistically not significant. Whereas 'p-value' for groups 3 and 4 was < 0.0001 and 0.003 respectively and was statistically highly significant. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that pulse oximetry can be used as a routine method for assessing the pulp vitality in primary, young permanent and mature permanent teeth.

@article{Tran2023,
	abstract = {AIMS: To explore whether electrodermal activity (EDA) can serve as a complementary tool for pulpal diagnosis (Aim 1) and an objective metric to assess dental pain before and after local anaesthesia (Aim 2). METHODOLOGY: A total of 53 subjects (189 teeth) and 14 subjects (14 teeth) were recruited for Aim 1 and Aim 2, respectively. We recorded EDA using commercially available devices, PowerLab and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Amplifier, in conjunction with cold and electric pulp testing (EPT). Participants rated their level of sensation on a 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) after each test. We recorded EPT-stimulated EDA activity before and after the administration of local anaesthesia for participants who required root canal treatment (RCT) due to painful pulpitis. The raw data were converted to the time-varying index of sympathetic activity (TVSymp), a sensitive and specific parameter of EDA. Statistical analysis was performed using Python 3.6 and its Scikit-post hoc library. RESULTS: Electrodermal activity was upregulated by the stimuli of cold and EPT testing in the normal pulp. TVSymp signals were significantly increased in vital pulp compared to necrotic pulp by both cold test and EPT. Teeth that exhibited intensive sensitivity to cold with or without lingering pain had increased peak numbers of TVSymp than teeth with mild sensation to cold. Pre- and post-anaesthesia EDA activity and VAS scores were recorded in patients with painful pulpitis. Post-anaesthesia EDA signals were significantly lower compared to pre-anaesthesia levels. Approximately 71{\%} of patients (10 of 14 patients) experienced no pain during treatment and reported VAS score of 0 or 1. The majority of patients (10 of 14) showed a reduction of TVSymp after the administration of anaesthesia. Two of three patients who experienced increased pain during RCT (post-treatment VAS > pre-treatment VAS) exhibited increased post-anaesthesia TVSymp. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show promising results for using EDA in pulpal diagnosis and for assessing dental pain. Whilst our testing was limited to subjects who had adequate communication skills, our future goal is to be able to use this technology to aid in the endodontic diagnosis of patients who have limited communication ability.},

	abstract = {Objectives Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) is a process that's initiated by orthodontic forces. As a consequence, the forces could restrict pulpal blood supply, possibly affecting dental pulp. The study aimed to review the available evidence on the short and long-term effects of orthodontic tooth movement on dental pulp sensitivity and to identify clinically relevant risk factors. Sources PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for papers from 1990 to the end of December 2021. Study selection The studies that evaluated dental pulp sensitivity of teeth undergoing OTM were included in the systematic review. Randomized, nonrandomized and case-controlled studies were included in the analysis. Risk of bias in each study was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Data The systematic search yielded an initial sample of 1110 studies, 17 were included in qualitative analysis. Most studies were classified as moderate risk of bias, however only limited long-term evidence with a higher risk of bias exists. Electric pulp test (EPT) sensitivity threshold during active OTM was increased by 4.25 SD (P < 0.001) and the relative risk (RR) of pulpal non-sensitivity was 13.27 (P < 0.001) higher compared to pre-orthodontic baseline status. Significant differences were between subgroups associated with the type of OTM. A positive relationship between pulpal non-sensitivity and mean patient age was discovered (P = 0.041). After OTM the risk of pulpal non-sensitivity remained 5.76 times higher (P < 0.001) in the long term. Conclusions Evidence showed that OTM could affect dental pulp sensitivity. The type of OTM and patients' age were identified as clinically relevant risk factors. Clinical significance Orthodontic tooth movement negatively impacts the sensitivity of dental pulp during active treatment and to a lesser degree in the long term. Pulpal sensitivity tests during active OTM should therefore be interpreted with caution. Data indicates younger patients have a lower risk of negative pulpal sensitivity during orthodontic treatment.},

	abstract = {Electric pulp testing (EPT) has been available for more than a century and used in dental practices worldwide. This article provides an overview of this diagnostic aid. The PubMed database from 1953 was used initially; the reference list for pulp testing featured 1071 articles, and for EPT identified 121 papers. A forward search was undertaken on these articles and using selected author names. Potentially relevant material was also sought in contemporary endodontic texts, while older textbooks on endodontics, operative dentistry and pain revealed historic information and primary research not found electronically. A short account of the innervation of the pulp is followed by an historic overview. Clinical considerations discussed include tooth isolation, glove wearing and tester electrode placement. Orthodontic treatment, pacemaker wearing and patient medications are considered. Research applications are also discussed. While EPT is valuable, no single pulp testing technique can reliably diagnose all pulp conditions. Careful collection of patient history regarding the problem tooth and prudent use of appropriate radiographs are also helpful. The shortcomings of electric tests, especially in the case of immature and concussed teeth, must be understood. The demeanour of the patient and the responses given by control teeth also require careful consideration.},

@article{McGrath1983,
	abstract = {This study investigated the quality and magnitude of sensations evoked by electrical tooth pulp stimulation. Detection threshold (the minimum current intensity that evoked a sensation) and pain threshold were determined for tooth pulp stimuli varying in frequency from 5 to 500 Hz. The effect of frequency and intensity of tooth pulp stimulation on the magnitude of sensations was assessed using visual analog scales and verbal descriptor scales. Detection thresholds were stable over experimental sessions and independent of the frequency of the stimulating current. Pain threshold varied as a function of frequency with a minimum value at 100 Hz. Stimuli that evoked non-pain sensations at low frequencies evoked pain sensations when frequency was increased from 5 to 100 Hz. Subjects were able to scale non-pain sensations over a range of stimulus intensities and frequencies. The lowest currents evoked sensations that were non-painful and were of constant magnitude despite changes in the frequency of stimulation. Higher stimulus currents evoked sensations that were non-painful at low stimulus frequencies and painful at high stimulus frequencies. Sensation magnitude at each stimulus intensity increased as a function of frequency. Temporal summation occurred in proportion to stimulus intensity. These findings suggest that the non-pain sensations evoked in tooth pulp are mediated by a distinct population of afferents that are not involved in the coding of pain. High frequency stimulation that increased the discharge rate of the lowest threshold pulpal afferents resulted in no summation of non-pain sensation and never produced pain. However, high frequency stimulation evoked greater magnitude sensations at higher stimulus currents, indicating that central summation mechanisms were critical for higher threshold afferents signaling more intense non-pain and pain sensations.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether EPT are repeatable over time. EPT results from 180 healthy teeth in 39 patients with 2-10 readings per tooth (total 692 readings) were analysed. Single measures intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged from 0.776 to 0.845 in teeth with 2-7 repeated measures (P < 0.001), indicating good repeatability. With eight or more measures per tooth, the ICC was low, indicating poor repeatability over longer follow-up times, but only seven teeth in two subjects were included in this analysis. The Pearson correlation showed no statistically significant correlation for 2-7 readings but when all readings were included, there was a statistically significant negative correlation. Hence, EPT has good repeatability.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis in endodontics requires an understanding of pulpal histology, neurology and physiology, and their relationship to the various diagnostic tests commonly used in dental practice. Thermal changes in the oral environment cause rapid displacement of dentinal tubular contents, resulting in pain. This effect, known as the hydrodynamic effect, is the regulator of pain sensation in thermal-pulp testing. Hundreds of axons enter the tooth from the apical foramen to provide it with its sensory supply. The nerve supply of the dentin-pulp complex is mainly made up of A fibres (both delta and beta) and C fibres. They are classified according to their diameter and their conduction velocity. The A fibres are mainly stimulated by an application of cold, producing sharp pain, whereas stimulation of the C fibres produces a dull aching pain. Because of their location and arrangement, the C fibres are responsible for referred pain. This first part of a 2-part review examines the relation between clinical sensations during the diagnostic visit and the neurophysiology of the dental pulp to explore the connection between the art (clinical diagnosis) and the science (neurophysiology) of endodontics.},

	abstract = {In laboratory research and clinical practice, externally-applied electric fields have been widely used to control neuronal activity. It is generally accepted that neuronal excitability is controlled by electric current that depolarizes or hyperpolarizes the excitable cell membrane. What determines the amount of polarization? Research on the mechanisms of electric stimulation focus on the optimal control of the field properties (frequency, amplitude, and direction of the electric currents) to improve stimulation outcomes. Emerging evidence from modeling and experimental studies support the existence of interactions between the targeted neurons and the externally-applied electric fields. With cell-field interaction, we suggest a two-way process. When a neuron is positioned inside an electric field, the electric field will induce a change in the resting membrane potential by superimposing an electrically-induced transmembrane potential (ITP). At the same time, the electric field can be perturbed and re-distributed by the cell. This cell-field interaction may play a significant role in the overall effects of stimulation. The redistributed field can cause secondary effects to neighboring cells by altering their geometrical pattern and amount of membrane polarization. Neurons excited by the externally-applied electric field can also affect neighboring cells by ephaptic interaction. Both aspects of the cell-field interaction depend on the biophysical properties of the neuronal tissue, including geometric (i.e., size, shape, orientation to the field) and electric (i.e., conductivity and dielectricity) attributes of the cells. The biophysical basis of the cell-field interaction can be explained by the electromagnetism theory. Further experimental and simulation studies on electric stimulation of neuronal tissue should consider the prospect of a cell-field interaction, and a better understanding of tissue inhomogeneity and anisotropy is needed to fully appreciate the neural basis of cell-field interaction as well as the biological effects of electric stimulation.},

@article{Widbiller2019,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A plethora of bioactive molecules present during tooth formation become sequestered in the mineralized dentin matrix and can be released into the pulp tissue after demineralization from carious lesions. However, neurotrophic factors are differentially expressed and secreted during various stages of odontogenesis. Thus, the aims of this study were (1) to investigate their presence and relative abundance in crown and root dentin and (2) to evaluate the bioactivity of dentin-derived proteins on neuronal cells. METHODS: Dentin matrix proteins (DMPs) were isolated from matched roots and crowns of extracted healthy human third molars. The total protein amount as well as the concentration of growth factors and neurotrophic proteins were quantified. The impact on neuritogenesis was determined with mouse trigeminal neurons in vitro and by a hydrogel implant model in vivo. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) sensitization of DMP-conditioned neurons was evaluated by single-cell calcium imaging. RESULTS: The relative concentration of neurotrophic molecules revealed that nerve growth factor is the most abundant neurotrophin with 3-fold increased expression in radicular dentin. Similarly, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 3 are more abundant in radicular than coronal dentin. Conversely, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor is more abundant in coronal dentin, whereas neurotrophin 4 is equally distributed. Dentin matrix proteins promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro and axonal targeting in vivo, with a greater effect observed by radicular dentin extracts. Furthermore, DMPs sensitized TRPV1 responses in mouse trigeminal neurons with greater activity seen with extracts from root dentin. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotrophic factors are differentially distributed between coronal and radicular dentin with different effects of dentin-derived proteins on axonal growth and targeting as well as the sensitization of TRPV1. Thus, extracellular proteins from the dentin matrix are likely involved in neurogenic responses to caries and could be exploited in clinical regenerative endodontics to promote reinnervation and enhance tissue regeneration.},

@article{Weisleder2009,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this article, the authors report on an in vivo study in which they assessed the validity of two commonly used cold pulp tests (carbon dioxide {$[$}CO(2){$]$}and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and an electrical pulp tester (EPT) in determining pulp vitality by using direct inspection of the pulp as the reference standard. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients undergoing endodontic therapy at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry (Chapel Hill) undergraduate clinic participated in this study. Before routine endodontic treatment, the authors classified participants by means of EPT, CO(2) and tetrafluoroethane as having either vital or necrotic pulps. Students recorded true pulpal status (vital/necrotic) by observing blood within the pulp chamber after an access cavity was made. The authors calculated the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of each test and the test combinations to describe their validity and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of teeth responding positively to all three tests contained vital pulps, whereas 90 percent of the teeth that failed to respond to any of the tests contained necrotic pulps. Ten percent of the teeth not responding to any of the tests contained vital pulps. For all other combinations of test results, 54 percent of teeth contained vital pulps, and 46 percent contained necrotic pulps. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of either of the cold tests and the EPT for diagnosis of pulpal status. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Cold test and EPT used in conjunction resulted in a more accurate method for diagnostic testing.},

@article{Mejare2015,
	abstract = {AIM: To demonstrate how the spectrum of diseased pulps may influence sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic studies on pulp status. METHODOLOGY: An original sample from a previous study consisting of 59 teeth scheduled for root canal treatment was used where the relationship between the response to electric pulp testing and the visual status of the pulp was evaluated. To alter the spectrum of diseased pulps, a hypothetical sample of asymptomatic teeth with deep caries lesions was added to the original sample. Sensitivity and specificity were then compared for the two samples. RESULTS: In the original sample of 59 teeth, sensitivity was 72{\%} and specificity 90{\%}. When the spectrum of diseased pulps was altered, sensitivity decreased to 67{\%} and specificity increased to 97{\%}. The change in disease spectrum also decreased the prevalence of necrotic pulps. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of diseased pulps included in a diagnostic study on the accuracy of electric pulp testing, and indirectly also disease prevalence (here pulp necrosis), influences estimates of sensitivity and specificity. This implies that estimates of diagnostic accuracy from one study with a particular tooth population spectrum may not apply to another tooth population with a different disease spectrum.},

@article{Stark1977,
	abstract = {A new electric pulp-testing system, the Testark, was developed in order to assess the potential of a different way of testing pulp sensitivity, thus making this electric pulp test more dependable than the conventional electric pulp-testing method. A study was conducted to evaluate the potential of the Testark system in comparison with a commercially available pulp tester. This pilot study consisted of application of three different desensitizing agents (sodium fluoride, test product. 'A', and test product 'B') to the cervical areas of hypersensitive teeth. The results were recorded with both the Testark and the conventional pulp tester simultaneously, and the sodium fluoride and test product 'B' proved to yield a beneficial effect by desensitizing the teeth after a single application. The level of desensitization with these agents was higher than the level obtained with the test product 'A' paste, which was utilized daily for 14 days. The results obtained with the conventional pulp tester differed by way of interpretation from those obtained with the Testark system. The Testark system proved to be easy to use and highly accurate in the data readings because of its high resolution. The Testark systemwas found to be more dependable than the commerical pulp tester, since it reduced the subjective errors which are inevitable when a commerical pulp tester is used. The Testark system is being developed further, and more studies are being conducted at the present time, in order to assess the full potential of the instrument.},

@article{Lin2006,
	abstract = {Uninfected necrotic tissue, such as that which follows a myocardial or cerebral infarct, is capable of inducing an inflammatory reaction. Eventually, the infarct is organized by granulation tissue. Why then, does uninfected devitalized pulp tissue, such as in traumatized teeth, not cause periradicular inflammation and does not become organized by granulation tissue? Four beagle dogs were used in this experiment. A total of 48 teeth, which included 24 maxillary and 24 mandibular incisors, were aseptically devitalized, leaving residual pulp tissues in the root canals, and equally divided into two groups. Group A (24 uninfected): A sterile cotton pellet was placed deep into the canal orifice before the pulp chamber and access opening were closed with a layer of zinc-oxide eugenol cement followed by glass ionomer cement. Group B (24 infected): The teeth were left open to the oral cavity for 7 days and then closed with a cotton pellet and zinc-oxide eugenol and glass ionomer cement. The animals were sacrificed one year after the experiment and prepared for histological examination of periradicular tissue responses to uninfected and infected devitalized pulp tissues. The results indicate that uninfected devitalized pulp tissues did not continuously release inflammatory mediators and cause persistent periradicular inflammation over a period of one year. However, infected devitalized pulp tissues induced various degrees of periradicular inflammation. Only the apical few millimeters of uninfected devitalized pulp tissue in the root canals were organized by granulation tissue from vital periodontal ligament tissue.},

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Open Grey databases were searched and after assessing eligibility criteria the data were extracted. True-positive, false-positive, true-negative, false-negative, sensitivity and specificity values were extracted or calculated if not presented. Quality of studies was evaluated based on the QUADAS 2 tool. Meta-analysis was performed in MetaDTA (v2.0; Shinyapps, RStudio PBC, Boston, MA, USA) and Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan web; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis and five for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio for pulse oximeter (PO), electric pulp tester (EPT), cold test (CT) and heat test (HT) was 628.5, 10.75, 17.24 and 3.47, respectively. Pairwise comparison demonstrated a higher pooled mean sensitivity and specificity with PO compared with EPT. Comparison between PO and CT and between PO and HT also demonstrated a higher pooled mean sensitivity and specificity for PO. Summary points on receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the ability of PO to correctly screen negatives in presenting patients as compared to EPT, CT and HT but no study was rated as good on quality assessment. PO can be considered as the most accurate diagnostic method as compared to EPT, CT and HT.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether electrical current can travel between adjacent teeth through contacting interproximal amalgam restorations. Twenty-two extracted human premolars were restored with class II amalgam restorations. They were then mounted in pairs in self-curing resin, simulating adjacent teeth. Only their restorations were allowed to contact. An electrical multimeter was used to supply electrical current and to measure any current passing through the mounted teeth. One current measurement was made from the buccal enamel of a tooth to the occlusal surface of the filling in that tooth. A second measurement was made from the buccal enamel of the same tooth to the occlusal surface of the adjacent filling. These two measurements were made for all 11 trials. Statistically, all current that entered the first tooth passed to the adjacent tooth. This finding suggests a potential source of error when using an electric pulp tester.},

@article{Nam2005,
	abstract = {AIM: To measure excessive electrical stimulus time during pulp testing via electromyography (EMG) in the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, voice and finger movement, and to determine whether excessive stimulus time could be attenuated by a specially designed automatic circuit breaker on the basis of the EMG signal. METHODOLOGY: The signals from three human responses (EMG, finger and voice), induced by the Digitest (Parkell Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) electric pulp tester, were captured using a MP100 (Biopac System Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) and recorded into a personal computer. The excessive stimulus time from activation to the end of electrical stimulation was calculated for each of these three responses. The automatic circuit breaker was designed to disconnect the electrical output of the electric pulp testing (EPT) unit immediately after detecting the preset EMG level (100 mV). Each of the right central incisors and first premolars of 23 healthy individuals (16 males and seven females) was tested to see whether there was a difference in tooth type or gender. This was analysed by Wilcoxon signed rank test (nonparametric paired t-test) and Mann-Whitney test (nonparametric independent t-test), respectively. RESULTS: Amongst three human responses, the electrical onset occurred in the order of EMG, finger and voice. Excessive stimulus time was 347.8 +/- 78.3 ms when observed by the EMG, 264.9 +/- 63.9 ms when observed by finger span and 229.4 +/- 41.8 ms when observed by the voice, which were all found to be significantly different (P < 0.05). When the automatic circuit breaker was used, the excessive stimulus time was 61.0 ms, which was 286.8 ms shorter than that measured from EMG onset when using the conventional EPT. CONCLUSIONS: When the automatic circuit breaker was used, excessive stimulus time on the basis of EMG was attenuated on average by 286.8 ms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors studied the treatment effect of full pulpotomy using a calcium silicate-based bioactive ceramic in adult permanent teeth with symptoms indicative of irreversible pulpitis. METHODS: Eighty-one adult permanent teeth with symptoms indicative of irreversible pulpitis in 78 patients aged 18 through 72 years were evaluated for inclusion in the study. After caries excavation, the pulp was amputated to the level of the canal orifices. After hemostasis was achieved, calcium silicate-based bioactive ceramic was placed as the capping agent. The cavity was sealed temporarily with a glass ionomer cement and then restored with flowable resin and composite resin after 2 weeks if no positive symptoms were reported or detected. Postoperative evaluation was performed by means of clinical and radiographic examination at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Overall success rates of the procedure were 96.3{\%} (78 of 81), 93.8{\%} (76 of 81), 92.6{\%} (75 of 81), and 92.6{\%} (75 of 81) at the 2-week, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month recall visits, respectively. Six of the 81 teeth failed and required root canal therapy. In these 6 teeth, 3 exhibited severe cold stimuli pain and spontaneous pain at the 2-week follow-up, 2 had no response to electric pulp testing with apical percussion pain and periapical rarefaction at the 3-month follow-up, and 1 tooth exhibited periapical rarefaction and labial mucosal fistula at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, full pulpotomy using a calcium silicate-based bioactive ceramic was a successful option for the treatment of adult permanent teeth with carious originated symptoms indicative of irreversible pulpitis. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Vital pulp therapy is no longer impossible for adult permanent teeth with carious originated symptoms indicative of irreversible pulpitis.},

	abstract = {A conducting media is necessary when using an electric pulp tester (EPT). The objective of this study was to observe differences in conductance through various media. We hypothesized that variations in current conductance through different media exist. The pulp chamber of a freshly extracted premolar was exposed, and the cathode of a voltmeter was inserted into the pulpal tissue. The anode was coupled to the EPT handpiece. The measurement taken during dry (no interface media) EPT tip-to-tooth contact was 0 V, which served as negative control. EPT tip directly touching the cathode measured 3.9V and served as positive control. A number of media readily available in the dental office were tested. Data was analyzed using single factor ANOVA. Listerine (3.3) conducted the most voltage (p<0.5). Of nonliquids, K-Y Brand UltraGel and Crest Baking Soda \& Peroxide Whitening Tartar Control toothpaste recorded significantly (p<0.05) higher voltage readings (1.4 V).},

This may be further complicated in paediatric dentistry where the practitioner is faced with a developing dentition, traumatized teeth, or young children who have a limited ability to recall a pain history for the tooth in question. A variety of pulp testing approaches exist, and there may be confusion as to their validity or appropriateness in different clinical situations. AIM: The aim of this paper is to provide the clinician with a comprehensive review of current pulp testing methods. A key objective is to highlight the difference between sensitivity testing and vitality testing. A biological basis for pulp testing is also provided to allow greater insight into the interpretation of pulp testing results.

Pulp sensibility tests include thermal and electric tests, which extrapolate pulp health from sensory response. Whilst pulp sensibility tests are the most commonly used in clinical practice, they are not without limitations and shortcomings. Pulp vitality tests attempt to examine the presence of pulp blood flow, as this is viewed as a better measure of true health than sensibility. Laser Doppler flowmetry and pulse oximetry are examples of vitality tests. Whilst the prospect is promising, there are still many practical issues that need to be addressed before vitality tests can replace sensibility tests as the standard clinical pulp diagnostic test. With all pulp tests, the results need to be carefully interpreted and closely scrutinised as false results can lead to misdiagnosis which can then lead to incorrect, inappropriate, or unnecessary treatment.},

	abstract = {Earlier ultrastructural investigations of human teeth have revealed differences in the innervation between crown and root dentin. In the present investigation, an intradental comparison of human teeth was made to estimate the sensitivity to different stimuli applied to two cavities, one in the buccal cusp and the other half-way between the cervix and the apex of the tooth. It was found that the pain produced by the different stimuli in the cuspal cavity was described as "sharp" or shooting, while the same stimuli applied to the root cavity provoked "dull" pain, often of a longer duration. Gentle stimuli, such as dry absorbent paper, only produced pain in the cuspal cavities. Ultrastructural examination revealed no nervous elements in the vicinity of the ground surface of the tested cavities in the crown or in the root. Odontoblastic cells including nuclei, were a common finding in the dentinal tubules of both the roots and the cusps, indicating aspiration of these cells. In some cases, in the cuspal areas, accompanying nerve-fibres had also been aspirated. The conclusion of the present investigation is that there are differences in sensibility between crown and root dentin. These differences are observed in both intensity and modality, supporting earlier findings of morphological discrepancies in the innervation of the coronal and root dentin.},

@article{Jafarzadeh2010,
	abstract = {The electric pulp test (EPT) is one type of pulp sensibility test that can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of the status of the dental pulp. However, like thermal pulp sensibility tests, it does not provide any direct information about the vitality (blood supply) of the pulp or whether the pulp is necrotic. The relevant literature on pulp sensibility tests in the context of endodontics up to January 2009 was reviewed using PubMed and MEDLINE database searches. This search identified articles published between November 1964 and January 2009 in all languages. The EPT is technique sensitive, and false responses may occur. Various factors can affect the test results, and therefore it is important that dental practitioners understand the nature of these tests and how to interpret them. Test cavities have been suggested as another method for assessing the pulp status; however, the use of this technique needs careful consideration because of its invasive and irreversible nature. In addition, it is unlikely to be useful in apprehensive patients and should not be required because it provides no further information beyond what thermal and electric pulp sensibility tests provide - that is, whether the pulp is able to respond to a stimulus. A review of the literature and a discussion of the important points regarding these two tests are presented.},

The pain perception threshold is considered in relation to different teeth, age, sex, lateral dominance, personality, and the area of electrode contact. The latter has proved interesting, for manipulation of it has led to possibly important findings on the nature of convergence in the trigeminal system, two-point discrimination, referred pain and somatopic representation of dental pulps in the medulla oblongata.},

	abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the clinical accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), an electric pulp test (EPT), and various thermal pulp sensibility tests. Methods Pulp tests were done on 121 teeth in 20 subjects by using LDF, EPT, and thermal pulp testing (CO2, Endo Frost {$[$}EF{$]$}, Ice) during 2 or 3 test sessions with at least 1-week intervals. The order of testing was reversed on the second visit. A laser Doppler flowmeter was used to measure mean pulp blood flow (Flux) calibrated against a brownian motion medium and zeroed against a static reflector. The laser source was 780 nm, with 0.5-mm fiber separation in the probe, 3.1 kHz as the primary bandwidth for filter set to 0.1-second time output constant. Customized polyvinylsiloxane splints were fabricated for each participant, and a minimum of 90-second recording time was used for each tooth. Raw data were analyzed by using repeated measure analysis of variance, pairwise comparisons, and interclass correlations (ICC). Results The accuracy of EPT, CO2, and LDF tests was 97.7{\%}, 97.0{\%}, and 96.3{\%}, respectively, without significant differences (P > .3). Accuracy of EF and Ice was 90.7{\%} and 84.8{\%}, respectively. EPT (P = .015) and CO2 (P = .022) were significantly more accurate than EF. LDF was more accurate than EF, but this was not statistically significant (P = .063). Ice was significantly less accurate than EPT (P = .004), CO2 (P = .005), LDF (P = .006), and EF (P = .019). With the exception of Ice (effect of visit: F2,38 = 5.67, mean squared error = 0.01, P = .007, $\eta$2p = 0.23), all tests were reliable. Ice (ICC = 0.677) and LDF (ICC = 0.654) were the most repeatable of the tests, whereas EPT (ICC = 0.434) and CO2 (ICC = 0.432) were less repeatable. Conclusions CO2, EPT, and LDF were reliable and the most accurate tests, but CO2 and EPT were less repeatable yet less time-consuming than LDF. EF was reliable but not as accurate as EPT and CO2 and less repeatable than Ice and LDF. Ice was the most repeatable but the least accurate and least reliable test.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the correlation between pulpal sensitivity to the electric pulp tester (EPT) and external apical root resorption (EARR) in four types of maxillary anterior teeth of fixed orthodontic treatment patients. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 232 anterior teeth of 58 patients (mean age 18.96 $\pm$6.13 years) treated with fixed orthodontic treatment were examined. The EPT readings were recorded at twelve time points immediately before archwire insertion. Root resorption of four maxillary incisors were measured by means of parallel periapical radiographs at three time intervals (six months interval from the start) through design-to-purpose software to optimize data collection. A multiple linear regression model and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to assess the association of EPT values and observed EARR (p< 0.05). RESULTS: The highest level of EPT measurement was recorded at initial visit, and then there was a decreasing trend in EPT level during treatment for the next six and twelve months. There was another increasing trend after six months till the finishing time of the treatment. There was a significant correlation between changes in root length and time of recording the root length (p< 0.001). There was significant positive correlation between changes in EPT level and amount of observed root resorption (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: The relative decrease in electric pulp test level could be a diagnostic sign of root resorption during orthodontic treatment. Further studies with longer follow up are needed to confirm the current results.},

	abstract = {Experiments have been carried out to investigate whether all tooth pulp afferent nerves are capable of producing pain. Monopolar and bipolar stimuli were applied to teeth in human subjects and sensory thresholds determined. EMGs were recorded from the masseter and the anterior digastric muscles. With stimuli up to three times the sensory threshold, no response could be detected in the digastric but at, or just above, the sensory threshold, inhibitory effects were produced in masseter muscle. The latency of the muscle response with bipolar stimulation was 18-22 msec. There was no evidence of stimulus spread to nerves outside the teeth. Bipolar and monopolar stimulation both produced the same sensation but this was not described as painful. It is concluded that some pulpal afferent nerves may not be capable of producing pain, and that the sensory and reflex responses at threshold were probably produced by the same fibres.},

The primary findings were: (a) teeth not responding to cold and either not responding or responding at readings greater than the tissue response to electrical had a high probability of being in the known pulpless or pulpally diseased subgroups; (b) the only false positive responses to cold in the three subgroups were in multirooted teeth with probable vital tissue remaining in at least one canal; and (c) in the three subgroups, if the false positive responses to electrical that responded at levels higher than the patient's tissue response were considered to be negative responses, the difference in false positives between cold and electrical became not statistically significant (p = 0.07).},

Following a better understanding of the histopathology of deep carious lesions, the histology of the cariously exposed pulp and the healing potential of the inflamed pulp, vital pulp therapy (VPT) is increasingly adopted around the world for the management of permanent teeth with clinical signs and symptoms indicative of irreversible pulpitis. Furthermore, VPT became a recognized treatment modality by the European Society of Endodontology (ESE) and the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) by virtue of its high success rates reported in outcome studies using contemporary hydraulic calcium silicate-based cements. However, proper case selection, strict asepsis, capping materials and good coronal seal are mandatory for success. The aim of this paper is to review the biological basis for VPT in symptomatic teeth with carious pulp exposure and to report on the outcome of pulpotomy in teeth with clinical diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations of variability in pulp sensitivity with sex, psychosocial variables, the gene that encodes for the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and chronic painful conditions (temporomandibular disorders {$[$}TMDs{$]$}). METHODS: The study was composed of 97 subjects (68 women and 29 men aged 20-44 years). The electric (electric pulp tester) and cold (refrigerant spray) stimuli were performed on mandibular lateral incisors. The results were expressed as pain threshold values for electric pulp stimulation (0-80 units) and as pain intensity scores (visual numeric scale from 0-10) for cold stimulation. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD were used to assess TMD, depression, and somatization. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was genotyped for 3 COMT polymorphisms (rs4680, rs6269, and rs165774) using the real-time TaqMan method. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the joint effect of the predictor variables (clinical and genetic) on pulp sensitivity (dependent variables). RESULTS: Threshold responses to electric stimuli were related to female sex (P < .01) and the homozygous GG genotype for the rs165774 polymorphism (P < .05). Pain intensity to cold stimuli was higher in TMD patients (P < .01) and tended to be higher in women. Multivariate linear regression identified sex and the rs165774 COMT polymorphism as the determinants of electric pain sensitivity, whereas TMD accounts for the variability in the cold response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that sex/a COMT gene variant and TMD as a chronic painful condition may contribute to individual variation in electric and cold pulp sensitivity, respectively.},

	abstract = {Peripheral A-delta and C fibers are activated during the production of ischemic or tourniquet pain; however, individual metabolic or molecular factors responsible for neural activation are not known. To elucidate these mechanisms the in vitro corneal nerve preparation was used. Electrophysiologic effects of individual metabolic perturbations associated with ischemia (hypoxia, hypoglycemia, lactic acid, and decreased pH) were investigated on A-delta and C fiber nociceptors. Increased tonic action potential activity occurred in C fibers but not in A-delta fibers after ischemia. The conduction velocity of C fibers was 0.85 +/- 0.2 m/s (mean +/- SD). Under control conditions (n = 43) there was very little fluctuation in the baseline action potential frequency (+/- 3.2{\%}). Hypoxia (n = 12) resulted in a 213 +/- 3.4{\%} (mean +/- SD) increase in C fiber action potential frequency relative to control (P less than 0.001, ANOVA). L-glucose substitution for D-glucose (n = 8) increased C fiber discharge frequency by 653 +/- 28{\%} relative to control (P less than 0.001) as did the combination of hypoxia and L-glucose substitution (n = 6) by 671 +/- 14{\%}. Comparison of hypoxia versus hypoxia and hypoglycemia conditions did not show them to be statistically different (P greater than 0.5). Lactate (10-1000 micrograms/ml) at a pH of 6.9 or 7.4 did not alter the action potential discharge frequency in corneal C fibers (n = 5, P greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate and compare the diagnostic accuracy including sensitivity, specificity, adjusted accuracy, adjusted positive predictive value (PPV), and adjusted negative predictive value (NPV) of cold pulp testing (CPT), heat pulp testing (HPT), electric pulp testing (EPT), laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and pulse oximetry (PO). METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched from January 1964 to December 2016. True-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative values were extracted from data in each study. Sensitivity, specificity, adjusted accuracy, adjusted PPV, and adjusted NPV were calculated from those values, if not presented. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, adjusted accuracy, adjusted PPV, and adjusted NPV. RESULTS: A total of 125 articles were identified, and 28 studies were included for the final review. The pooled estimates of sensitivity for CPT, EPT, HPT, LDF, and PO were 0.87, 0.72, 0.78, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. Those of specificity were 0.84, 0.93, 0.67, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. Those of adjusted accuracy were 0.84, 0.82, 0.72, 0.97, and 0.97, respectively. For adjusted PPV, they were 0.81, 0.89, 0.62, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively, and for adjusted NPV, they were 0.87, 0.80, 0.79, 1.00, and 0.99, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LDF and PO were the most accurate diagnostic methods, and HPT was the least accurate diagnostic method. EPT showed high accuracy when testing vital teeth (specificity = 0.93) but low accuracy when assessing nonvital teeth (sensitivity = 0.72). CPT had moderate accuracy when evaluating vital (specificity = 0.84) and nonvital (sensitivity = 0.87) teeth.},

Data were collected from 59 pairs of maxillary anterior teeth (38 pairs of central, 21 pairs of lateral incisors) in 51 patients (range 12-18years, mean age 14·6$\pm$1·73years, 28 women, 23 men). The teeth with complete endodontic fillings constituted the study group, and the healthy, contralateral teeth of the same patients were constituted the control group. The calculated sensitivity was 0·915 for the EPT and 0·813 for the PO. And the specificity of EPT was 0·881 and PO was 0·949. The difference between the LDF values obtained from the study, and control group was statistically significant (P=0·0001). The findings of this study indicated that LDF can reliably discriminate the vitality of the teeth with a sensitivity and specificity of 1·0 for this sample. Laser Doppler flowmetry was found to be a more reliable and effective method than PO and EPT of assessing the pulpal status of human teeth.},

@article{Richards2015,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Accurate identification and assessment of an inflamed or necrotic tooth is essentialfor endodontic treatment. The purpose of this research was to investigate possible sources of error associated with the use of the electric pulp tester (EPT). METHODS: Forty-six intact teeth (23 tooth pairs) in 22 patients were evaluated in vivo. For the tooth pairs, one tooth had to have been previously endodontically treated and restored with a class II amalgam restoration. The restoration was required to have proximal contact with a class II amalgam of another vital posterior tooth. EPT was performed on pulpless and vital teeth for experimental groups (enamel, restoration, contacting, or isolated). RESULTS: The highest rate of false positive responses (82{\%}) was found in the pulpless restored contacting group, suggesting that EPT impulses are able to travel through proximal metallic contacts and stimulate teeth distant from the EPT probe. All vital tooth groups had a high rate of positive responses with no significant diferences. CONCLUSIONS: If a tested tooth contains an interproximal restoration contacting adjacent restorations or the gingival, the teeth must be isolated (rubber dam) and the EPT probe should be placed in a region suspected to have uninterrupted tubule paths to the pulp.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of electric pulp testing (EPT) using the bridging technique in comparison to a cold test on crowned teeth. METHODS: Thirty teeth were included in this study. Only one crowned tooth from each subject was included. The adjacent teeth served as controls. The crowned teeth were tested for pulp vitality using a bridging EPT technique and cold test. Vitality was confirmed upon access based on bleeding or lack of bleeding from detected root canal systems. The data was statistically analyzed using the McNamara test (P<0.05). RESULTS: The sensitivities of the cold test and bridging EPT were 87{\%} and 66{\%} respectively. Accuracy for cold and bridging EPT were 87{\%} and 67{\%} respectively. The cold test demonstrated a statistically significant higher accuracy and sensitivity than the bridging EPT. However, no significant difference was detected in the specificity between the two tests. CONCLUSION: Both EPT and cold test should be considered as an adjunctive diagnostic tool when determining pulp status in a crowned tooth. Pulp sensitivity tests are essential but the results should be interpreted in combination with other clinical signs/symptoms.},
